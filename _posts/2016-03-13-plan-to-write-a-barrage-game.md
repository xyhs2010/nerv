title: Plan to write a barrage game
summary: based on html5 canvas
---
I will write a barrage game, a little aircraft running between net of bullets. Steps
I expect are listed below:

*  Write a canvas, with an aircraft on it, which can be controlled by l/r/u/d;
*  Think out a kind of orbit, comply with which the aircraft's speed can be reffered
    by it's location and speed in last piece of time;
*  Realize that orbit;
*  Find out a way to draw hundreds of bullets;
*  Write a judgement whether bullets touches the aircraft;
*  Add scoring system;

Once I finish a step, I'll make a commit on [barragegame](github.com/xyhs2010/barragegame/).
